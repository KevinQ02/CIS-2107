/* Personal Notes:
    Lecture:
        • Worry about printing the output, positioning,
        • point rubric:
            - 0 pts for max not showing (print it tho)
            - 10 pts max not being implemented
            - 2 pts notnlletting user know
            - 5 pts sum wrong
            - 3 pts printing array wrong
            - 7 pts handcoding array
            - 3 pts not printing sum of all row & colums (dont ask the user anything about)
            - 3 pts hand coding sum
    Lab 05 Notes:
        • We can choose what the return type should be
        • Part 1) 5 functions must be made:
            1) Max: returns the max value in the 2d array
            2) RowSum: returns the sum of the elements in Row x of the 2d array
            3) ColummnSum: returns the sum of the elements in Column x of the 2d array
            4) IsSquare: checks if the array is square (every row has the same length as the 2d array itself)
            5) DisplayOutputs: dislpays the 2 dim-array element
        • Part 2) Testing main:
            - Declare a 2-dim array: 
                • read the number of rows and columns fromm the user
                    Ex.) If a user enters 3 for the number of rows and enters 3 for the colums 
                        • Then we declare ann array of 9 and then read 9 entries and store them in the array
                        • Remeber the Run-time Array Length
            - Make calls to all functions in part 01 to match the sample demo bellow
            -
